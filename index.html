    <div class="player-text">The talking about the Leafs team, the first player that comes to mind is Auston Matthews. He was the first overall pick in 2016, which was just the spark this team needed in the midst of a rebuild. Setting a franchise record of 60 goals in 73 games played in 2021-2022. Sporting number 34, Matthews is soilidified into the heart and soul of Leafs Nation. </div>

      <div class="player-text">To the suprise of nobody, Mitch Marner has become quite the star on the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Markham native paved his way to the NHL by dominating his way to a memorial cup with the OHL's London Knights. His high hockey IQ and slick moves makes it impossible to take your eyes off of him when hes on the ice. </div>

    <div class="player-text">A historic signing in the summer of 2018 brought the first captain of the Toronto Maples Leafs in years. Being the first overall pick in 2009 by the New York Islanders, John Tavares developed into an elite play-maker and leader on and off the ice.  </div>

    <div class="player-text">Perhaps the most divisive star on the Leafs is William Nylander. Everyone knows someone (mainly Uncle's) who spout "trade Nylander" everytime he steps on the ice. Despite this, Nylander has proven to be an essential member of the team especially in the playoffs where he coninues to shine.</div>
